Followed a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uZYKcKHgU0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g0MQZfHwKcuB0Yswgb3gA5) (mostly) to get this far. The Net Ninja is 10/10 for quality content!

See app in action on [firebase hosting here](https://ninja-todo-7cb02.firebaseapp.com/).

## Improvements I made are

- Firebase authentication (github + email signon) + vuex
- Load/create projects based on the logged in user
- Still lots to do but a really cool learning exercise!
